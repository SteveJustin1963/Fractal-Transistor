### Designing a Conceptual Device Using a "Fract-sistor"

- **Demonstration**: A device induces controlled, reversible transitions in electron scattering dynamics, shifting from regular to chaotic motion of electrical current.

- **Device Structure**: 
  - Gate-defined semiconductor cavity.
  - Shape evolves from square to 'Sinai' geometry.

- **Fractal Behavior**: 
  - Remarkable fractal patterns emerge in device conductance at low temperatures.
  - First example of a man-made system where fractals can be introduced or removed controllably.

- **Electron Scattering**: 
  - Transition between regular and chaotic electron motion is achieved through cavity shape modulation.

- **Classical Simulations**: 
  - Simulations determine electron paths associated with conductance at various scales during the transition.

- **Fractansistor Integration**:
  - Fractal structures in the fractansistor could exhibit similar controllable transitions between regular and chaotic current motion.
  - Combining fractal patterning techniques with this scattering device concept could enhance control over charge and spin currents.

- **Fabrication**: 
  - Fractansistor uses techniques like Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) and Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) to create nanoscale fractal geometries, similar to the cavity shaping in the scattering device.

- **Applications**:
  - Ultra-sensitive sensors, low-power electronics, quantum computing, reconfigurable circuits, and chaotic control in electron dynamics.

- **Potential**:
  - Controllable fractal introduction/removal.
  - Room-temperature quantum effects and chaotic dynamics.
  - Next-generation electronic devices with enhanced reconfigurability and sensitivity.
